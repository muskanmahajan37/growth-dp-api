This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.\n\n **Programmatic Example**\n\nTaking our hiring manager example above. First of all we have an interviewer interface and some implementations for it\n\n```php\ninterface Interviewer\n{\n    public function askQuestions();\n}\n\nclass Developer implements Interviewer\n{\n    public function askQuestions()\n    {\n        echo 'Asking about design patterns!';\n    }\n}\n\nclass CommunityExecutive implements Interviewer\n{\n    public function askQuestions()\n    {\n        echo 'Asking about community building';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow let us create our `HiringManager`\n\n```php\nabstract class HiringManager\n{\n\n    // Factory method\n    abstract public function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer;\n\n    public function takeInterview()\n    {\n        $interviewer = $this->makeInterviewer();\n        $interviewer->askQuestions();\n    }\n}\n\n```\nNow any child can extend it and provide the required interviewer\n```php\nclass DevelopmentManager extends HiringManager\n{\n    public function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer\n    {\n        return new Developer();\n    }\n}\n\nclass MarketingManager extends HiringManager\n{\n    public function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer\n    {\n        return new CommunityExecutive();\n    }\n}\n```\nand then it can be used as\n\n```php\n$devManager = new DevelopmentManager();\n$devManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about design patterns\n\n$marketingManager = new MarketingManager();\n$marketingManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about community building.\n```\n\n**When to use?**\n\nUseful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime.

And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.   \n\n**When to use?**\n\nWhen there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved\n\n\n"

But there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what types of sauces would you like?

Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.\n\nWikipedia says\n> The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.\n\nHaving said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point or the other we have all seen a constructor like below:\n\n```php\npublic function __construct($size, $cheese = true, $pepperoni = true, $tomato = false, $lettuce = true)\n{\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see; the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand and it might become difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on growing if you would want to add more options in future. This is called telescoping constructor anti-pattern.\n\n**Programmatic Example**\n\nThe sane alternative is to use the builder pattern. First of all we have our burger that we want to make\n\n```php\nclass Burger\n{\n    protected $size;\n\n    protected $cheese = false;\n    protected $pepperoni = false;\n    protected $lettuce = false;\n    protected $tomato = false;\n\n    public function __construct(BurgerBuilder $builder)\n    {\n        $this->size = $builder->size;\n        $this->cheese = $builder->cheese;\n        $this->pepperoni = $builder->pepperoni;\n        $this->lettuce = $builder->lettuce;\n        $this->tomato = $builder->tomato;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we have the builder\n\n```php\nclass BurgerBuilder\n{\n    public $size;\n\n    public $cheese = false;\n    public $pepperoni = false;\n    public $lettuce = false;\n    public $tomato = false;\n\n    public function __construct(int $size)\n    {\n        $this->size = $size;\n    }\n\n    public function addPepperoni()\n    {\n        $this->pepperoni = true;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    public function addLettuce()\n    {\n        $this->lettuce = true;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    public function addCheese()\n    {\n        $this->cheese = true;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    public function addTomato()\n    {\n        $this->tomato = true;\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    public function build(): Burger\n    {\n        return new Burger($this);\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd then it can be used as:\n\n```php\n$burger = (new BurgerBuilder(14))\n                    ->addPepperoni()\n                    ->addLettuce()\n                    ->addTomato()\n                    ->build();\n```\n\n**When to use?**\n\nWhen there could be several flavors of an object and to avoid the constructor telescoping. The key difference from the factory pattern is that; factory pattern is to be used when the creation is a one step process while builder pattern is to be used when the creation is a multi step process.\n\n\n"

There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let me better explain it using the code example below.\n\nIn plain words\n> Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.\n\nWikipedia says\n> A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.\n\n**Programmatic Example**\n\nTaking our security door example from above. Firstly we have the door interface and an implementation of door\n\n```php\ninterface Door\n{\n    public function open();\n    public function close();\n}\n\nclass LabDoor implements Door\n{\n    public function open()\n    {\n        echo \"Opening lab door\";\n    }\n\n    public function close()\n    {\n        echo \"Closing the lab door\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThen we have a proxy to secure any doors that we want\n```php\nclass Security\n{\n    protected $door;\n\n    public function __construct(Door $door)\n    {\n        $this->door = $door;\n    }\n\n    public function open($password)\n    {\n        if ($this->authenticate($password)) {\n            $this->door->open();\n        } else {\n            echo \"Big no! It ain't possible.\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function authenticate($password)\n    {\n        return $password === '$ecr@t';\n    }\n\n    public function close()\n    {\n        $this->door->close();\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd here is how it can be used\n```php\n$door = new Security(new LabDoor());\n$door->open('invalid'); // Big no! It ain't possible.\n\n$door->open('$ecr@t'); // Opening lab door\n$door->close(); // Closing lab door\n```\nYet another example would be some sort of data-mapper implementation. For example, I recently made an ODM (Object Data Mapper) for MongoDB using this pattern where I wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method `__call()`. All the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case of `find` or `findOne` data was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead of `Cursor`.\n\n\n"

First of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting\n```php\nclass JobPost\n{\n    protected $title;\n\n    public function __construct(string $title)\n    {\n        $this->title = $title;\n    }\n\n    public function getTitle()\n    {\n        return $this->title;\n    }\n}\n\nclass JobSeeker implements Observer\n{\n    protected $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function onJobPosted(JobPost $job)\n    {\n        // Do something with the job posting\n        echo 'Hi ' . $this->name .

    "question": "\nReal world example\n> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.\n\nIn plain words\n> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.\n\nWikipedia says\n> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.\n\n**Programmatic example**\n\nLet's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern\n\n```php\n// Visitee\ninterface Animal\n{\n    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation);\n}\n\n// Visitor\ninterface AnimalOperation\n{\n    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey);\n    public function visitLion(Lion $lion);\n    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin);\n}\n```\nThen we have our implementations for the animals\n```php\nclass Monkey implements Animal\n{\n    public function shout()\n    {\n        echo 'Ooh oo aa aa!';\n    }\n\n    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)\n    {\n        $operation->visitMonkey($this);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Lion implements Animal\n{\n    public function roar()\n    {\n        echo 'Roaaar!';\n    }\n\n    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)\n    {\n        $operation->visitLion($this);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dolphin implements Animal\n{\n    public function speak()\n    {\n        echo 'Tuut tuttu tuutt!';\n    }\n\n    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)\n    {\n        $operation->visitDolphin($this);\n    }\n}\n```\nLet's implement our visitor\n```php\nclass Speak implements AnimalOperation\n{\n    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)\n    {\n        $monkey->shout();\n    }\n\n    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)\n    {\n        $lion->roar();\n    }\n\n    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)\n    {\n        $dolphin->speak();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then it can be used as\n```php\n$monkey = new Monkey();\n$lion = new Lion();\n$dolphin = new Dolphin();\n\n$speak = new Speak();\n\n$monkey->accept($speak);    // Ooh oo aa aa!    \n$lion->accept($speak);      // Roaaar!\n$dolphin->accept($speak);   // Tuut tutt tuutt!\n```\nWe could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.\n\n```php\nclass Jump implements AnimalOperation\n{\n    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)\n    {\n        echo 'Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!';\n    }\n\n    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)\n    {\n        echo 'Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!';\n    }\n\n    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)\n    {\n        echo 'Walked on water a little and disappeared';\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd for the usage\n```php\n$jump = new Jump();\n\n$monkey->accept($speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!\n$monkey->accept($jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!\n\n$lion->accept($speak);     // Roaaar!\n$lion->accept($jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!\n\n$dolphin->accept($speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt!\n$dolphin->accept($jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared\n```\n\n\n"
